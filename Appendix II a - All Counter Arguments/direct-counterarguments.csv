arg13,Balanced DietNV,V,Processed meat is not healthy and consuming meat on a daily basis (or even several times a day) isn't either. Reducing your meat consumption and substituting it with fresh vegetables and grains will contribute to a much more balanced diet.,12

arg61,Quick & Easy,NV,Meat substitutes are just as quick and easy to prepare.,6
arg62,Quick & Easy,NV,"That is a question of habit. As soon as you learn how to make your favourite vegetarian meals, it will be just as quick",10
arg63,Quick & Easy,NV,"Potatoes, grains and beans are also quick and easy to prepare",8
arg64,Quick & Easy,NV,"Vegetarian options are not necessary difficult to prepare and might be even faster to make. It all depends on the dish. Roasting a chicken in the oven is not necessarily ""quick"". And whether you fry chicken or mushrooms/quorn mince doesn't make a difference time-wise",11

arg74,Quick & Easy,V,Vegetarian food can be very quick and easy to prepare,8
arg75,Quick & Easy,V,"It's just as quick, and easier, to prepare vegetarian alternatives.",4
arg76,Quick & Easy,V,Plants and fruits are way easier to prepare cause some you don't even need to cook and less likely to get food poisoning,2

arg81,Taste,NV,This depends on the way of preparation and not the fact that it's meat.,9
arg82,Taste,NV,There is a lot of food which is much healthier and tastes just as good and no animals have to die and you don't consume antibiotics.,5
arg83,Taste,NV,Raw meat doesn't. its about the way of preparation and seasoning. You can fry and/or batter zuccini and it will taste good too.,10
arg84,Taste,NV,"If you enjoy the taste of meat, there are vegetarian meat substitutes that resemble the taste of meat (e.g.Quorn). Otherwise, you could try portobello mushrooms, aubergines or tempeh. They have a meaty texture and taste good too",11
arg85,Taste,NV,Many vegetables such as portabello mushrooms are just as flavorful as meat.,10
arg86,Taste,NV,so many meals without meat taste good,3
arg87,Taste,NV,taste is subjective and meat is too broad a term,4
arg88,Taste,NV,Things taste good also based on recipe. There are many fantastic recipes for flavourful and enjoyable food.,12
arg89,Taste,NV,"There are sauces, spices and herbs that enhance the flavour of food. It likely tastes good because of everything else that is in it.",13
arg90,Taste,NV,So do many other foods and removing meat from a dish does not impact taste,1
arg91,Taste,V,"That depends on the way of preparation. A lot of meat eaters rather miss the texture than the ""taste"" of meat. This can be handled by using mock meat that imitate the texture. Every larger supermarket nowadays has a big section with vegetarian options.",12
arg92,Taste,V,There are many meals that taste good and do not contain meat. You probably do not eat steak ever day. And -lentils with spinach and feta- (substitute here with anything else you find tasty and doesn't contain meat) tastes better than mash with cooked sausages.,6
arg93,Taste,V,"The taste of meat depends on the way you prepare it. Preparing meat without any seasoning will not taste good. If it is the -texture- you are after, then there are many meat substitute that can satisfy that.",14
arg94,Taste,V,"I dislike the flavour of meat and prefer nuts, eggs, cheeses and beans",2
arg95,Taste,V,"A wide variety of vegetable, fruit, leafy greens, seeds and nuts tastes better, even without added seasoning or dressings.",4
arg96,Taste,V,this is the only reason people eat meat,2
arg97,Taste,V,So many other foods taste just as lovely! By enjoying the taste of meat you say you enjoy dead corpses and the flavour of that is not even a taste! It is barbaric. It’s the flavour and marinade that is cooked with the meat that provides flavour.,2
arg98,Taste,V,Many meat substitutes can satisfy that taste,6
arg99,Taste,V,The good taste of meat requires some animal to suffer greatly. It doesn't seem right that we do something only for our pleasure if it requires some other being to suffer for it.,10
arg100,Taste,V,so do plants and nothing has to die,2
arg101,Variety,NV,Fried chicken without any seasoning adds less variety to your meal than falafel or fried tofu in terriyaki sauce. It's about how you prepare it. Not the fact that it's meat.,6
arg102,Variety,NV,Vegetables and meat substitutes probably add even more variety. It is unlikely that you have 20 different ways to prepare meat. You probably have a few standard recipes you follow all the time.,6
arg103,Variety,NV,You can add variety with other foods - not necessarily meat,12
arg104,Variety,NV,You can add variety not just by adding meat. You could look up different vegetarian recipes and add variety with vegetarian options.,11

arg107,Variety,NV,"Variety can be created without having to resort to eating meat, for example by using a wider array of vegetables",7
arg108,Variety,NV,Variety can also be found in substitutes and there are many different types of meals that can be made.,6

arg110,Variety,NV,Various foods could add variety,9
arg111,Variety,V,You don't need meat to add variety to your meal. Get creative and look up some vegetarian recipes. If you don't have time for that replace your meat with meat-substitutes.,11
arg112,Variety,V,"You can add variety (probably even more variety) with vegetarian options: trying out different recipes, trying out different meat substitutes (e.g. Quorn) or by just replacing meat with something else.",15
arg113,Variety,V,"Trying out vegetarian dishes will force you to look up more recipes, experiment with different foods and may result in even more variety and diversity than you had with meat.",12
arg114,Variety,V,Since not eating meat I have explored more protein foods and now enjoy a much wider variety of foods,4
arg115,Variety,V,"Actually, there is more than enough meal variety available with vegetables, nuts and seeds.",3
arg116,Variety,V,There is more variety meals than just adding meat to it,4
arg117,Variety,V,"Variety can be offered with different vegetables and fruit products, carbohydrates and different cuisines. To get variety in meals meat is not necessary.",11
arg118,Variety,V,`meat substitutes are versatile and a wide variety of vegetarian dishes can be made.,4
arg119,Variety,V,"There are so many more varieties of vegetables than meats. They could provide much more variety in your diet, if you ate a larger variety.",4
