Chatbot,"All right.
However, excessive consumption of meat can lead to many health problems, including heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,I enjoy it.
Chatbot,"Okay, but why?"
User,It tastes great.
Chatbot,"I understand 
However, you will reduce your risk for cancer, heart disease and diabetes if you cut down your meat consumption"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,It tastes good and I am healthy.
Chatbot,expand please...
User,I am used to eating meat all the time.
Chatbot,"Fair enough!
But eating processed meat several times a week (or even day) can lead to serious health issues due to the high consumption of saturated fat, hormones and medicine (antibiotics) in the meat"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,There are so many options. It is my favorite.
Chatbot,elaborate please...
User,"I am aware of the risks, but I am willing to take my chances."
Chatbot,"Ok, I see.
But meat consumption is not sustainable and will lead to environmental problems that will impact our future life on earth"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,I don't know. I do not want to hurt the environment. Maybe I should reduce my meat intake.
Chatbot,"I get your point!
However, eating too much meat is linked to health complications such as an increased likelihood of a stroke or heart attack."
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,It is a tough habit to break.
Chatbot,please expand 
User,I am a person of habits
Chatbot,"I understand 
But eating less meat improves your general health, enables your digestive system to process foods more easily and gives you more energy, leaving you feeling less sluggish and tired"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,I guess I am stupid.
Chatbot,"Okay, but why?"
User,Because meat is unhealthy for me and the environment.
Chatbot,"All right.
However, raising animals for food requires massive amounts of land, food, energy, and water and causes immense animal suffering"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,I am a bad person.
Chatbot,a bit more detail please! Why?
User,"Obviously, meat is horrible. You are making me feel bad now."
Chatbot,"All right.
However, eating less meat will have a positive effect upon the environment, helping to slow down the rapid rates of deforestation"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,"I have told you already. I like it, but I should quit. It is not worth it. I don't know if i can though."
Chatbot,"I get your point!
But if people continue consuming meat in such high quantities as today, problems like deforestation, water shortages and greenhouse gas emissions will continue to grow"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,Really? This bot is pissing me off. I eat meat because it is my choice.
Chatbot,"I know what you mean
However, the less animals bred purely to be slaughtered, the less resources used to transport them. Smaller, more natural levels of animals would create less impact on the environment too"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,I like it. I want it. I am stupid. Give me a break.
Chatbot,"I take your point
However, switching to a more plant based diet will lead to a more sustainable life on earth and have a positive impact on our future"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,Meat tastes better than plants.
Chatbot,a bit more detail please! Why?
User,I am not a big fan of vegetables.
Chatbot,"I get your point!
But your reduction of meat will leave you feeling better physically and mentally. There is less risk of health complications, including food poisoning and an increased benefit of adding plant based foods to your diet to make it healthier and more varied"
User,I agree
Chatbot,Why do you eat meat then?
User,hahaha. Come on. Quit asking me.
Chatbot,please tell me more...
User,I have explained everything.
Chatbot,"I ran out of arguments  let's end the chat here. One more question. Please tell me what applies most to you: 
1: I definitely wouldn't 
2: I probably wouldn't 
3: I might 
4: I probably would

consider reducing my meat consumption"
